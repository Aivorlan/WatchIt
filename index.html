        Welcome to the WatchIt experience! The days of searching endlessly for your favorite TV shows and Movies is over. 
        Powered by the leading databases for entertainment our app gives you instant access to thousands of Movies and TV shows 
        from all genres! We even have an exclusive Anime category combined of 7 databases solely focussed on Anime content. 
        In the app, you are able to filter your results to the streaming platforms that you’re exclusively subscribed to! 
        If your preferred streaming platform doesn’t have the Movie or TV show available our app will list the platform that does! 
        Once your eye is set on a selection simply click or tap the “Watch It” button to begin viewing.
